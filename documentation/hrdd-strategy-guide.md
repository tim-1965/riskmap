# Enhanced HRDD Strategy Guide

## Overview

The enhanced Labor Rights Risk Assessment Tool now includes **customizable effectiveness percentages** for Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) strategies, allowing senior managers to:

- **Adjust effectiveness assumptions** based on their specific industry experience
- **Model different effectiveness scenarios** to understand impact ranges
- **Use industry-specific benchmarks** for more accurate assessments
- **Compare preset strategies** for quick scenario analysis

## Updated Default Effectiveness Values

Based on industry research and best practices, the new default effectiveness percentages are:

| HRDD Strategy                | Default Effectiveness | Rationale                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continuous Monitoring**    | 85%                   | Real-time data, IoT sensors, digital platforms provide high visibility |
| **Unannounced Social Audit** | 50%                   | Surprise factor effective but limited scope and frequency              |
| **Announced Social Audit**   | 15%                   | Preparation time allows issues to be hidden temporarily                |
| **Self-Assessment (SAQ)**    | 5%                    | Self-reporting bias and limited verification                           |
| **No Engagement**            | 0%                    | No monitoring = baseline risk level                                    |

### 3. Real-time Impact Analysis

- **Weighted Effectiveness**: Shows blended effectiveness across all strategies
- **Estimated Risk Reduction**: Calculates potential risk reduction percentage
- **Strategy Recommendations**: Identifies most effective approaches in use

## Risk Calculation Formula

### Enhanced Formula

```
Final Risk Score = Base Country Risk Ã— Industry Multiplier Ã— HRDD Multiplier

Where:
HRDD Multiplier = 1.5 - (Weighted Effectiveness)
Weighted Effectiveness = Î£(Strategy Coverage Ã— Strategy Effectiveness)
```

### Effectiveness Range Impact

- **Maximum Risk Reduction**: 66% (with 100% continuous monitoring at 85% effectiveness)
- **Typical Risk Reduction**: 20-40% (with balanced mixed strategies)
- **Risk Increase**: Up to 50% (with high percentage of no engagement)

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### High-Risk Industries (Textiles, Mining, Agriculture)

- **Higher effectiveness** for continuous monitoring due to complex supply chains
- **Lower effectiveness** for self-assessments due to supplier sophistication gaps
- **Recommended**: Aggressive or balanced approaches

### Regulated Industries (Healthcare, Finance)

- **Higher baseline effectiveness** due to existing compliance frameworks
- **Better self-assessment** reliability due to regulatory requirements
- **Recommended**: Balanced or conservative approaches

### Technology Industries (Electronics, Telecommunications)

- **Higher continuous monitoring** effectiveness due to digital infrastructure
- **Better data integration** capabilities
- **Recommended**: Aggressive approaches with high continuous monitoring

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Budget Planning Scenario

**Question**: "What's the ROI of investing in continuous monitoring?"

**Process**:

1. Set current state (e.g., 70% announced audits, 30% SAQ)
2. Model future state (e.g., 40% continuous monitoring, 30% unannounced, 30% announced)
3. Compare risk reduction percentages
4. Calculate cost-benefit based on risk reduction

### 2. Effectiveness Calibration

**Question**: "Are our audit programs as effective as industry standards?"

**Process**:

1. Use "Customize Effectiveness" mode
2. Adjust effectiveness percentages based on internal audit findings
3. Compare results with industry benchmarks
4. Identify improvement opportunities

### 3. Supplier Tier Strategy

**Question**: "How should we monitor different supplier tiers?"

**Process**:

1. Model Tier 1 suppliers (high continuous monitoring)
2. Model Tier 2 suppliers (balanced approach)
3. Model Tier 3 suppliers (SAQ-heavy approach)
4. Calculate weighted average risk across all tiers

### 4. Crisis Response Planning

**Question**: "How much additional risk do we face if we reduce monitoring?"

**Process**:

1. Set baseline with current monitoring levels
2. Model reduced monitoring scenario (budget cuts)
3. Calculate risk increase percentage
4. Determine minimum acceptable monitoring levels

## Advanced Analytics Features

### Effectiveness Benchmarking

The tool provides industry-specific effectiveness benchmarks:

```javascript
// Example API response for textiles industry
{
  "industry": "textiles",
  "benchmarks": {
    "continuous_monitoring": {
      "min": 80,
      "max": 90,
      "recommended": 85
    },
    "unannounced_audit": {
      "min": 45,
      "max": 65,
      "recommended": 55
    }
    // ... other strategies
  }
}
```

### Scenario Comparison

Users can save and compare multiple HRDD configurations:

- **Current State**: Existing monitoring approach
- **Target State**: Desired monitoring approach
